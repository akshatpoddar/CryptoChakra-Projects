# CryptoChakra-Projects

This repository is to store all tasks and projects related to my internship at CryptoChakra from the Summer of 2025. This will involve all my notes, any jupyter notebooks, and any presentations that I create for this internship or to support my learning. Each project will be organized within it's own directory. 

I have a Python virtualenv on my local machine which has all the necessary libraries for the projects and this virtualenv is running Python 3.10.13 (since this version supports tensorflow as of today). To avoid any issues with installing and running the libraries used, please make sure to use the same version of Python.
